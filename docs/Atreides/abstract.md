# Abstract

This project aims to analyze the coverage of publications available in IRIS within OpenCitations Meta. We seek to identify which types of publications are better covered, how many citations within the OpenCitations Index involve IRIS publications as both citing and cited entities, and the extent to which these citations involve publications outside of IRIS. To achieve this, we filter and transform datasets from both OpenCitations Meta and Index, as well as the original IRIS dump, to produce new datasets. Some of these datasets we use to gather the necessary entities to answer our research questions, others we publish to aid further research for this specific subject. We develop research software in Python to support the creation of datasets and their analysis. This research provides a comprehensive overview of the representation of the publications in IRIS within the OpenCitations Corpora. By identifying the types of publications that are better covered, researchers and academic institutions can understand the visibility and impact of their work within a broader scholarly context, helping assess the influence and dissemination of research produced by IRIS-affiliated scholars and aiding academic administrators and policymakers in evaluating research performance and making funding decisions. Analyzing citations within the OpenCitations Index involving publications in IRIS provides valuable insights into the interconnectedness of research, helping identify potential gaps in collaboration and knowledge exchange and enabling researchers to seek new partnerships and interdisciplinary opportunities.
