# Abstract

This study aims to analyze the coverage of publications available in the CRIS (Current Research Information System) infrastructure of the University of Bologna and implemented in the IRIS platform, within the databases of OpenCitations. Spe- cifically, we quantify the proportion of IRIS publications included in OpenCitations Meta, examine the types of publications best covered, evaluate the number of cita- tions within OpenCitations Index involving IRIS publications as either citing or cited entities, and the extent to which these citations reference works outside of IRIS. Our methodology filters and transforms data dumps of IRIS and OpenCit- ations, creating novel datasets that we use to gather the answers to the research questions. Our findings reveal that only 37.7% of IRIS is covered in OpenCitations Meta, with journal articles exhibiting the highest coverage. We identified 7,723,941 citations in OpenCitations Index involving IRIS-related publications, with 3,989,540 coming from non-IRIS sources, and 3,441,830 pointing to publications outside IRIS. Only 353,414 citations involved both citing and cited publications from IRIS. These findings highlight deficiencies and discrepancies, mainly related to duplicate entries in both the IRIS system and the OpenCitations corpora. Our research output could aid in identifying and correcting these issues, and also providing a baseline for the sharing of missing valuable data across the two infrastructures which would enhance the overall effectiveness and accuracy of both infrastructures.
