    "This project aims to investigates the discoverability of University of Bologna's scholarly output within OpenCitations Meta, a platform that stores and delivers bibliographic metadata for alle the publications involved in OpenCitations Index which contains recording citations allowing the user to visualize all of the citation links between a document and another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this project aims to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze the coverage ****of University of Bologna publications deposited in the IRIS institutional repository within OpenCitations Meta.\n",
    "- Identify the publication types better represented in OpenCitations Meta for the university's research.\n",
    "- Quantify the citation impact of these IRIS publications using OpenCitations data. This includes the number of citations they receive (cited entity) and give (citing entity).\n",
    "- Further dissect the citations to determine how many involve publications outside of IRIS (both citing and cited) and how many represent citations within IRIS (both citing and cited).\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology used will be all compliant to the core values of Open Science, the data and the softwares used will all be made available to allow the user to replicate, reproduce and validate the conclusions drawn by by the end results of the project.\n",

Tomorrow i will gather all of the information i can on the resources needed to answer the research question, maybe try to establish a first workflow after I visualize the scope of the whole project and also I should finalise the description for the software in the dmp.</p>"
