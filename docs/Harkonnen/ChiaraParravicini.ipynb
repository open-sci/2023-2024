    "Is that possible to create a new index of citations which contains typed citations where a peer review (citing entity) reviews (specific citation function) a publication (cited entity)? What is the necessary transformation of the Crossref dump necessary to create such an index to be compliant with the OpenCitations Data Model? What are the top publication venues in terms of the number of peer reviews received? How many peer reviews in Crossref are included in OpenCitations Meta? How many articles that have been reviewed by a peer review are included in OpenCitations Meta?"
