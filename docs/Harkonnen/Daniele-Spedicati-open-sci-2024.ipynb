It refers to the ability to define specific types of citations within an index, such as a citation where a peer review (citing entity) reviews (specific citation function) a publication (cited entity). In this context, \"typed citation\" indicates that the citation is characterized by a specific relationship between the source and the target of the citation, which is defined based on a specific type of interaction between the two involved entities.\n",
