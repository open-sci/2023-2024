Purpose: This study examines the feasibility of:
- creating a new citation index that includes peer review interactions with publication.
- The necessary transformation of the Crossref dump to create an index compliant with the OCDM.
- To find out what are the venues with the highest number of peer reviews received, how many peer reviews present in Crossref are also included in OpenCitations Meta, and how many articles reviewed by a peer review are included in OpenCitations Meta.

Study design/methodology/approach: Analyzing the Crossref dataset, we explore how to integrate peer review interactions into citation indices while ensuring compatibility with the OpenCitations Data Model.

Findings: To the moment we don't have any relevant findings (other than the consideration that each member of the group has written in his/her personal notebok which may be considered more of intuitions untill further analysis) being that the project has just started, we expect complexities involved in incorporating peer review data into citation indices, necessitating careful schema adjustments.

Originality/value: This study contributes to improving scholarly metadata and understanding research impact by proposing a novel citation index that captures peer review interactions.
