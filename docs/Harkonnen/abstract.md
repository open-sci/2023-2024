The purpose of this study is to create a citation index that includes typed citations where a peer review (citing entity) reviews a publication (cited entity) following the OpenCitations Data Model (OCDM).

The study involves analyzing and manipulating the 2023 Crossref data dump. Crossref is a non-profit organization that facilitates the exchange of scholarly metadata. The outcome of the study is the development of a software capable of extracting typed entities identified as peer reviews from Crossref dataset and integrating additional information about the reviewed entities from the same dataset. This software generates CSVs and a Turtle file that conform to the OCDM.

Based on PROCI results, it is determined that the journal receiving the highest number of peer reviews is PeerJ. Furthermore, it is found that approximately 5,689 out of 348,463 of Crossref's peer reviews are present in Meta (1.6\% ), while 70,260 are the Publications in Meta over the 77,660 found in Crossref ( 90,5\%).

This study enhances scholarly metadata and deepens the understanding of research impact by proposing a novel citation index that captures peer review interactions.

This study was run strictly following Open Science principles, and, as such, our research outcomes are fully reproducible..
